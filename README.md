# HyperV-Manager
A solution to auto build virtual machines

### Why?
I work as part of a support organisation where cutomers are using dfferent operating systems, different versions of Microsoft software and then there is the software I support. Trying to handle a full library of all the different combinations is a none starter and as such the need to a way to select what you want and to have a system automatically build this for you.
